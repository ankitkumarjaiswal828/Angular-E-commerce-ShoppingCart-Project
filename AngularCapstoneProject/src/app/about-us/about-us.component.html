       <h2>Journey of ShoppingCart</h2>
        <p><b>ShoppingCart</b> was founded in October 2007 in Bangalore by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and
        former Amazon employees. The company was started from a two-bedroom apartment in Kormangala, Bengaluru. The
        initial investment was provided by their families, which was INR 2 Lakh from each family. The website was kicked off in
        October 2007 and the company was only limited to selling books at that time country-wide shipping.ShoppingCart slowly
        grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.ShoppingCart acquired WeRead in 2010 from Lulu.com that helped it build its foundational strength which was the digital
        retail of books. This space was otherwise only shared by very limited number of players at that time in the market, such
        as Landmark and Infibeam. ShoppingCart used aggressive discounts and focused on customer service to move towards a
        leadership position in the market. WeRead consisted of a large network of readers (~3 Million) with around 60 million
        books. </p>
